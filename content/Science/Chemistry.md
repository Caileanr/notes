# Physical and Chemical Changes
## What are Physical and Chemical Changes?

- Chemical changes are changes that form new substances, these are not easily revertible
- Physical changes are changes that do not form new substances, these are easily revertible

| Properties            | Chemical Changes | Physical Changes |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| New Substances Formed | Yes              | No               |
| Easily Revertible     | No               | Yes              |

| Chemical Changes                     | Physical Changes              |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Temperature has Changed              | Substance changes state       |
| New Smell                            | New Substances are not formed |
| Light is produced                    | The change is easily reverted |
| Gas or Bubbles have formed           |                               |
| Change in Colour                     |                               |
| The Change cannot be easily reverted |                               |

> [!NOTE] When do Physical and Chemical Changes Occur?
> Physical and Chemical changes occur when a reaction occurs. These can either be a Physical change, Chemical change, or both


# Atoms, Sub Particles, and Ions
## What are Atoms, Sub Particles, and Ions?

- Atoms are the building blocks of everything and are what makes up the world
- Sub Particles, also known as sub-atomic particles, are particles smaller than atoms
- Ions are atoms or groups of atoms with a non-neutral charge to have a full valence (outer) shell

![[atom_diagram.png]]

## What are Atoms made up of?
Atoms are made up of three different sub particles - Protons, Electrons, and Neutrons. The Protons and Neutrons make up the nucleus while the electrons surround the nucleus. 
<br><br>

|          | Proton       | Neutrons | Electrons   |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Charge   | Positive (+) | Neutral  | Negative(-) |
| Weight   | 1            | 1        | ~1/2000     |
| Position | Nucleus      | Nucleus  | Shells      |
<br>

There are a few of ways to find the number of protons and electrons in an atom. To find the number of electrons or protons, look at the atomic number of the element. This will always be equal to the number of protons, and therefore electrons. You can also find the number of protons by subtracting the number of neutrons from the atomic mass

$$Atomic Mass-NumberOfNeutrons=NumberOfProtons$$



> [!NOTE] The Relationship between Protons and Electrons
> In an element, there are always an equal number of Protons and Electrons. This is because particles with a positive charge attract particles with a negative charge due to magnetism. This then gives the atom a neutral charge. Although, this is different in an ion as an atom loses or gains electrons to have a full valence shell!

Meanwhile for Neutrons, there is only one way to find how many there are. First, round the atomic mass to the closest whole number. You then subtract the atomic number from the atomic mass and this will leave you with the number of Neutrons in the atom!

$$
Atomic Mass -AtomicNumber = NumberOfNeutrons
$$

> [!NOTE] Having trouble finding the Atomic mass and Atomic Number?
> If you're having trouble finding the Atomic mass, it is always the bigger number, while the atomic number is always the smaller number!


## Electrons and Ions 
Electrons surround the nucleus in shells. Electron Shells are a way for scientists to visualise zones around the nucleus of an atom which each contain a specific number of electrons. The number of electrons in each Electron Shell goes as follows: 

- In the First shell there are a maximum of two electrons, 
- In the Second shell there are a maximum of 8 electrons, 
- In the Third shell there are a maximum of 8 electrons, 
- In the Fourth shell there are a maximum of 18 electrons.

| S # | E # |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   |
| 2   | 8   |
| 3   | 8   |
| 4   | 18  |

As stated earlier, Ions are atoms or group of atoms which have lost or gained electrons. This is so they gain a full valence shell which makes them stable. 

Writing Ions is easy, simply write the chemical symbol of the element the ion is, then add the number of electrons gained or lost in the top right of the element's letter/s followed by the charge of the ion. If an ion only loses or gains 1 ion, then you simply write the charge in the top right. Remember, electrons are negative so gaining them gives the ion a negative charge while losing them gives the ion a positive charge!

> [!NOTE] Example Ion
> Sodium has 11 protons and therefore 11 electrons! 
> 
> The first electron shell takes 2 electrons which leaves 9 Electrons. The second electron shell then takes 8 electrons which leaves only one electron left. It is easier to lose 1 electron then to gain 7 therefore a sodium ion only has 10 electrons and 11 protons! 
> 
> This gives sodium a positive charge of one which is then written as Na⁺

## Drawing Atoms and Ions
To draw atoms and ions, draw a circle with the chemical symbol at the top centre (If you are drawing an ion, draw the ion's charge along with the element symbol). Below it, write  `P =` followed by the number of protons. Below that write `N =` followed by the number of neutrons. Next, draw a circle for each electron shell you need around the circle. Use crosses for the electrons, I like to space them out evenly. Finally draw the electron configuration (This is the number of electrons in each shell). Remember the first four can have a maximum of the following number of electrons respectfully: 2, 8, 8, 18.

# Acids and Bases
## What are acid and bases?
There are many different substances in this world, they can be categorized into three different groups: Acids, Bases, and Neutrals, each with their own characteristics. 

<h5><u>Acids</u></h5> 
Acids are solutions with a higher amount of H<sup>+</sup> than OH<sup>-</sup> ions. Acids tend to have some common characteristics such as being sharp and sour in taste, being corrosive (eats away at other substances), and having a pH less than 7. The strength of the acid depends on the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions, with more making a stronger acid and less making a weaker acid. 

Common examples of Acids are:
- Lemons (Citric Acid)
- Oranges (Citric Acid)
- Vinegar (Acetic Acid)
- Stomach Acid (Hydrochloric Acid, HCl)
- Sulfuric Acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) 
- Nitric Acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>)
- Phosphoric Acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)

<h5><u>Bases</u></h5> 
Bases are solutions with a higher amount of OH<sup>-</sup> than H<sup>+</sup> ions. Bases tend to have some common characteristics such as being slippery to the touch, being good at removing grease and oil, and having a pH greater than 7. The strength of the base depends on the concentration of OH<sup>-</sup> ions, with more making a stronger base and less making a weaker base. 

Common examples of Bases are:
- Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite)
- Soap
- Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)
- Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)
- Ammonia (Sometimes found in hair bleach)

<h5><u>Neutral Solutions</u></h5>
Neutral solutions are solutions with the same amount of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions. The most commonly found neutral solution is H<sub>2</sub>O (water). They have a pH of 7

## Indicators
Since water, acids, and bases tend to be colourless, this makes it basically impossible to identify with the human eye. This is why we use indicators! The two we are going to learn about are litmus paper and universal indicator.

<h5><u>Litmus Paper</u></h5> 
There are many different types of Litmus paper, however the two types we will focus on is Red and Blue Litmus paper. Using litmus paper is simple, simply dip the paper into the solution and check if it changes colour or stays the same colour. This will depend on whether the solution is a Acid, Base, or Neutral solution. Depending on if the Litmus Paper changes colour or not will tell you what type of solution it is. In acids, Red litmus paper stays red while blue litmus paper turns red. In Bases, its the opposite: Red litmus paper turns blue while blue litmus paper stays blue. Finally in neutral solutions Red and Blue Litmus paper stay the same colour. 

|         | Red Litmus | Blue Litmus |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Acid    | Red        | Blue        |
| Neutral | Red        | Blue        |
| Base    | Blue       | Red         |

<h5><u>Universal Indicator</u></h5>  
Universal indicator measures how much H<sup>+</sup> is in a solution. This is also where pH gets its name! Universal indicator represents this as a colour, with warmer colours being an acid and cooler colours being a base! You can use this chart below for reading pH levels from universal indicator: 

![[universal_indicator.png]]


> [!NOTE] Why use Litmus Paper instead of Universal Indicator?
> Universal Indicator may seem like the superior option, however depending on the situation it is not. Although universal indicator shows you the strength of the acid or base, it contaminates the solution and therefore makes it useless as the chemical reaction is occurring in the solution. Litmus Paper does not contaminate the solution as the chemical reaction occurs in the Litmus Paper instead. Therefore depending on your situation Litmus Paper may be the better choice!

# Reactions

We will learn about four different reactions: Neutralisation, Neutralisation (Carbonate), Metal + Acid and Metal Oxide.  For this, it is recommended to memorise the following acids, bases, and if you don't want to calculate charges of ions every time, this ion table:

| Acid/Base | Name                | Symbol  | Name Change | Forms CO₂       |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Acid      | Hydrochloric Acid   | HCl     | Chloride    | Depends on base |
| Acid      | Sulfuric Acid       | H₂SO₄   | Sulfide     | Depends on base |
| Acid      | Nitric Acid         | HNO₃    | Nitrate     | Depends on base |
| Base      | Sodium Hydroxide    | NaOH    | Sodium      | No              |
| Base      | Magnesium Hydroxide | Mg(OH)₂ | Magnesium   | No              |
| Base      | Sodium Carbonate    | CaCO₃   | Sodium      | Yes             |
| Base      | Calcium Carbonate   | Na₂CO₃  | Calcium     | Yes             |


> [!NOTE] Is it an acid or base?
> Notice how the name of acids end with "Acid", while the end of bases either end with Hydroxide or Carbonate. You can use this to identify if something is an acid or base

> [!NOTE] Brackets in the symbols?
> Brackets are used when you have a group of atoms for a single ion and need to say there is more than one of said ion. An example of this is the Ion Hydroxide whose chemical symbol is OH<sup>-</sup>

## Reading and Writing Chemical Reactions

Before we can get into doing equations, we must first learn how to write and read solutions. Since chemical symbols for elements can have more than one letter, we use a capital letter to say it is the beginning of a new ion. The small number in the bottom right of an ion is the number of said ion. Next, Brackets are used when you have a group of atoms for a single ion and need to say there is more than one of said ion. Finally, a normal number in front of a solution is the amount of said solution in a reaction. Remember not to write charges in your finished equations, you can use them to help you solve them though!

> [!NOTE] Examples
> - HCl is made up of 1 Hydrogen ion and 1 Chloride ion
> - HNO₃ is made up of 1 Hydrogen ion, 1 Nitrogen ion, and 3 Oxygen ions
> - Mg(OH)₂ is made up of 1 Magnesium ion and 2 Hydroxide ions
> - 2HCl means there are 2 Hydrochloric Acids

Chemical equations, like math, are read left to right. The reactants are on the left hand side followed by an arrow and the products on the right hand side:

$$Reactants → Products$$
## Neutralisation Reaction 
A neutralisation reaction is when an acid and a base react to form a salt and water. This isn't the same type of salt you use in cooking though. So how do you name the salt? The first part of the salt comes from the base. If the base is a magnesium based base, the first part of the salt would be "magnesium" and nothing changes. The second part of the salt comes from the acid. If the acid was hydrochloric acid, the second part of the salt would be "chloride" therefore the salt would be "Magnesium Chloride". Refer to the table above for the name changes for the acid part. If the base ends with carbonate, you should use a carbonate neutralisation reaction.


$$ Acid + Base → Salt + Water$$

![[word_equation_example.png]]

> [!NOTE] Neutralisation Reaction Example
> $$2HCl + Mg(OH)₂ → MgCl₂ + 2H₂O$$
> 
> <br>2 Hydrochloric Acid + Magnesium Hydroxide → Magnesium Chloride + 2 Water


## Neutralisation (Carbonate) Reaction
A carbonate neutralisation reaction is the same as a normal neutralisation reaction however the base creates carbon dioxide as one of the products as well as salt and water. You use a carbonate neutralisation reaction when the base ends with carbonate. 

$$ Acid + Base → Salt + Water + CarbonDioxide$$

> [!NOTE] Neutralisation (Carbonate) Reaction Example
> $$Na₂CO₃+2HCl → 2NaCl + H₂O + CO₂$$
> 
> <br>Sodium Carbonate + 2 Hydrochloric Acid → 2 Sodium Chloride + 1 Water + 1 Carbon Dioxide 

## Metal + Acid Reaction
A Metal + Acid reaction is when a metal is dissolved in an acid, creating a salt and hydrogen gas. 

$$Metal + Acid → Salt + HydrogenGas$$

> [!NOTE] Metal + Acid Reaction Example
> $$Mg + 2HCl = MgCl₂ + H₂$$
> 
> <br>Magnesium + Hydrochloric Acid → Magnesium Chloride + Hydrogen Gas

## Metal Oxide Reaction
The Metal Oxide reaction is when you burn metal in oxygen. The metal and oxygen react together to form a metal oxide. 

$$Metal + Oxygen → Metal Oxide$$

> [!NOTE] Metal Oxide Reaction Example
> $$2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO$$
> 
> <br>Magnesium + Oxygen Gas → Magnesium Oxide

## Balancing Equations
Balancing equations is when you make sure there is an equal amount of each ion on both the reactant side and the products side. Here is an example on how it works:

![[unbalanced_example.png]]

Notice in this example how there are not enough Chloride ions on one side, and too many oxygen and hydrogen ions on the other? You can fix the chloride ion balance issue by adding another hydrochloric acid which then leaves you with 2 extra hydrogen ions and 1 extra oxygen ion. These can be used to create another water which then makes your equation balanced as there are an equal amount of ions on each side.

# Testing for Gases 
In science, you often want to test for things to prove something is happening. One thing you may want to test for are gases! Specifically we will focus on the following gases: Hydrogen gas, Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide.

## Testing for Hydrogen gas - The pop test!

To test for hydrogen gas, you can do the pop test. Since hydrogen is flammable, it will combust (burn). Therefore when a splint is lit on fire and brought to the gas, a pop sound can be heard. The best way to do this is to use your thumb to cover the top of the test tube and let the hydrogen gas build up in the test tube. You then release your thumb and bring the splint to a bit above the test tube, if you hear a pop then there is hydrogen gas!

 ![[pop_test.png]]

## Testing for Carbon Dioxide
There are two ways to test for carbon dioxide: The flame test and the lime-water (calcium hydroxide) test. When lime-water reacts with carbon dioxide it goes from clear to a milky colour. An issue with this test is its hard to get gas from a reaction to flow into the lime water so we typically use a different method. This is the flame method. 

![[limewater.png]]

Since fire needs oxygen to burn, if you were to suffocate the fire in carbon dioxide, it would put out the flame. This can be done using your thumb to cover the top of the test tube to let carbon dioxide build up and putting a match on fire down into the test tube. If the flame goes out then there is carbon dioxide

![[carbon_dioxide_match_test.png]]

## Testing for Oxygen
You can also use fire to test for oxygen! Unlike carbon dioxide which kills a fire, oxygen feeds the fire. Therefore if you were to use your thumb to cover the test tube and let oxygen build up, then put a match with only a spark of a flame left, it will revive the flame. If the match is still on fire, the fire will burn brighter as it has more oxygen to burn.
