<b><u>What is a force?</u></b><br>
A force is a pull, push, or twist of an object
Unit = Newtons (N)

You can categorize a force in 2 ways:
- Contact force: When the object transmitting the force is in contact with the object receiving the force
- Non-contact force: When the object transmitting the force is not in contact with the object receiving the force

Currently you are experiencing 4 different forces: weight force, support force, push force, and friction. You can pair weight and support together along with push and friction together as they work against each other. Weight force keeps you from floating away while support force keeps you from crumbling into a pancake. Meanwhile push force is what moves you forward while your friction force resists that movement you from moving forward forever.

| Name of Force | Direction of Force | Opposite Force |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Weight        | Down               | Support        |
| Support       | Up                 | Weight         |
| Push          | Forward            | Friction       |
| Friction      | Backward           | Push           |
> [!NOTE] Balanced Weight and Support Forces!
> Since you're not getting crushed by your weight force or floating away from your support force, those forces are currently balanced! Hopefully your weight force doesn't greater than your support force :P

<b><u>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</u></b><br>
We use the term balanced and unbalanced to say whether each force and its opposite is equal or not. If a force is balanced that means the forces are equal and therefore you are either stationary or moving at a constant speed relative to the force. Meanwhile if a force is unbalanced then you are accelerating (moving faster and faster).

> [!NOTE] Arrow Sizes
> Notice how the weight and support arrows are the same size, while the push arrow is larger than the friction arrow? That's because the push force is greater than the friction force!

The weight and support forces are balanced, that means the car isn't floating away or getting crushed which is good. However the push and friction forces are unbalanced. This means the car is accelerating in the direction of the greater force which is the push force.  

To calculate how much push force is exerted on the car, we need to calculate the resultant force. To do so, we use the following equation:<br>

$$Force -OppositeForce=ResultantForce$$

Doing so we can find out there is 2000N of push force being exerted on the car.

<b><u>Calculating Force</u></b><br>
The formula to calculate force is:<br><br>
$$Force = Mass \cdot Acceleration$$
<br><br>Where force (F) is in newtons (N), mass(M) is in kilograms (kg) and Acceleration(A) is in Metres per second per second (m/s/s or ms<sup>-2</sup>) 

| Name         | Symbol | Unit                         | Unit Symbol              |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Force        | f      | Newtons                      | N                        |
| Mass         | m      | Kilograms                    | kg                       |
| Acceleration | a      | Metres per Second per Second | m/s/s or ms<sup>-2</sup> |

>[!NOTE] Weight â‰  Mass
> Weight and mass is different. Weight is a force which is your mass multiplied by gravity. Mass on the other hand is how much the matter you are made up of weighs. To get your Mass from your weight, divide your weight by 10 (or if you want to specific 9.8)
> 
> Weight is also actually measured in newtons, not kilograms :P

You can also calculate mass and acceleration if you know the force and the other variable! You can use this force triangle to rearrange the formula:

> $$10Kg \cdot 10ms^{-2} = 100N$$   
> An object with a mass of 10 kilograms and accelerating at 10m/s/s has 100 newtons of force
> 
><h4><u>Acceleration = Force / Mass</u></h4>
>
> $$100N \div 10Kg = 10ms^{-2}$$ <br>
> An object with 100 newtons of force that has a mass of 10 kilograms is accelerating at 10m/s/s
> 
> <h4><u>Mass = Force / Acceleration</u></h4>
> 
> $$100N \div 10ms^{-2} = 10Kg$$ <br>
> An object with 100 newtons of force that is accelerating at 10m/s/s has a mass of 10 kilograms


<b><u>Calculating Displacement</u></b><br>
The formula  for calculating displacement is:<br>

$$Displacement = Velocity \cdot Time$$
<br><br>Where displacement(d) is in metres (m), velocity(v) is in metres per second (m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup>), and time(t) is in seconds (s).

| Name         | Symbol | Unit              | Unit Symbol            |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Displacement | d      | Metres            | m                      |
| Velocity     | v      | Metres per Second | m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup> |
| Time         | t      | Seconds           | s                      |

Like force, you can also calculate velocity and time if you know the distance and the other variable! You can use this Displacement triangle to rearrange the formula:

<h2><u>Electricity and Magnetism</u></h2>
As we know, everything is made out of atoms. Atoms are made up of  electrons, protons and neutrons. So, why is this important? Neutrons aren't that important in this situation however since we're all made up of electrons and protons that means everything has a charge. 

Most objects are not electrically charged, this is because they have the same amount of electrons, which have a negative charge, and protons, which have a positive charge. This makes them, as stated earlier, not electrically charged and as such electrically neutral. For example this ball would be electrically neutral as they have the same amount of electrons and protons.

![[unnamed.png]] 


The thing about charges is that they can repel and attract. This is because they want to be electrically neutral. As such if they are positively or negatively charged, they will repel things with the same charge as them. However if something had a different charge to them, then they would attract the object. This table below is an easy way to remember it:

| Charges | +       | -       |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| +       | Repel   | Attract |
| -       | Attract | Repel   |

> [!NOTE] As the saying goes, Opposites attract!

<h3><u>Conductors and Insulators</u></h3>
One final thing we need to learn about are conductors and insulators! 

<b><u>Conductors</u></b> <br>
Conductors are simply substances that allow electrons (charge) to flow through easily! You can think of conductors as basically a greenlight, allowing all the electrons to go through.

Common examples of conductors are:
- Metals (Such as copper, gold, and brass)
- Non-distilled Water (Normal drinking water)
<br>
<b><u>Insulators</u></b> <br>
Insulators are, as the name suggests, substances that don't allow electrons (charge) to flow through easily. You can think of electricity as heat. Insulators, like in houses, trap the heat and make it hard for it to escape through the insulation. Insulators do the same thing with electricity. Although they have the same name, the insulators in houses and in electricity are not the same!

Common examples of insulators are:
- Plastics
- Glass
- Wool
- Distilled Water (Pure water)

<h3><u>Electricity</u></h3>
<b><u>Static Electricity</u></b> <br>
Now that we've learnt about charges, we can understand what Electricity is and how Electricity works. There are two types of Electricity: Static and Current/Live. Static Electricity occurs naturally and you've probably experienced it yourself. Have you ever been jumping on a trampoline and when you went to get off, been zapped by the metal framing of the trampoline? That was static electricity! 

Static electricity is when the amount of positive and negative charges on the surface of a material or between materials are different. So how does this occur? We can make static electricity occur by rubbing two materials against each other. This works best with insulators rather than conductors since electrons can't move well in insulators! 

So why does rubbing two materials against each other create static electricity? When the two objects rub against each other, this allows electrons to be transferred from one object to the other, giving said object more electrons than protons and therefore a negative charge. 

Certain conditions allow for static electricity to work best, it is important to understand why!

| Condition                                | Why?                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The materials should be insulators       | The materials must be insulators so the charge cannot disperse              |
| The materials must be rubbed together    | Friction is required to move charges from one material to the other         |
| The materials and atmosphere must be dry | Dry conditions ensure that the charge is not conducted away in the moisture |

> [!NOTE] Why does our hair stick up after a balloon is rubbed on it? 
> When you rub a balloon on your hair, the friction transfers electrons from your hair to the balloon. This leaves your hair positively charged and the balloon negatively charged. As we know, objects with the same charge repel each other, so our individual hairs repel each other which causes them to separate and stand on end. <br><br> ![[c6181314b7b2c0833274a82bc8251762.jpg]]
