<b><u>What is a force?</u></b><br>
A force is a pull, push, or twist of an object
Unit = Newtons (N)

You can categorize a force in 2 ways:
- Contact force: When the object transmitting the force is in contact with the object receiving the force
- Non-contact force: When the object transmitting the force is not in contact with the object receiving the force

Currently you are experiencing 4 different forces: weight force, support force, push force, and friction. You can pair weight and support together along with push and friction together as they work against each other. Weight force keeps you from floating away while support force keeps you from crumbling into a pancake. Meanwhile push force is what moves you forward while your friction force resists that movement you from moving forward forever.

| Name of Force | Direction of Force | Opposite Force |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Weight        | Down               | Support        |
| Support       | Up                 | Weight         |
| Push          | Forward            | Friction       |
| Friction      | Backward           | Push           |
> [!NOTE] Balanced Weight and Support Forces!
> Since you're not getting crushed by your weight force or floating away from your support force, those forces are currently balanced! Hopefully your weight force doesn't greater than your support force :P

<b><u>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</u></b><br>
We use the term balanced and unbalanced to say whether each force and its opposite is equal or not. If a force is balanced that means the forces are equal and therefore you are either stationary or moving at a constant speed relative to the force. Meanwhile if a force is unbalanced then you are accelerating (moving faster and faster).

> [!NOTE] Arrow Sizes
> Notice how the weight and support arrows are the same size, while the push arrow is larger than the friction arrow? That's because the push force is greater than the friction force!

The weight and support forces are balanced, that means the car isn't floating away or getting crushed which is good. However the push and friction forces are unbalanced. This means the car is accelerating in the direction of the greater force which is the push force.  

To calculate how much push force is exerted on the car, we need to calculate the resultant force. To do so, we use the following equation:<br>

$$Force -OppositeForce=ResultantForce$$

Doing so we can find out there is 2000N of push force being exerted on the car.

<b><u>Calculating Force</u></b><br>
The formula to calculate force is:<br><br>
$$Force = Mass \cdot Acceleration$$
<br><br>Where force (F) is in newtons (N), mass(M) is in kilograms (kg) and Acceleration(A) is in Metres per second per second (m/s/s or ms<sup>-2</sup>) 

| Name         | Symbol | Unit                         | Unit Symbol              |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Force        | f      | Newtons                      | N                        |
| Mass         | m      | Kilograms                    | kg                       |
| Acceleration | a      | Metres per Second per Second | m/s/s or ms<sup>-2</sup> |

>[!NOTE] Weight â‰  Mass
> Weight and mass is different. Weight is a force which is your mass multiplied by gravity. Mass on the other hand is how much the matter you are made up of weighs. To get your Mass from your weight, divide your weight by 10 (or if you want to specific 9.8)
> 
> Weight is also actually measured in newtons, not kilograms :P

You can also calculate mass and acceleration if you know the force and the other variable! You can use this force triangle to rearrange the formula:

> $$10Kg \cdot 10ms^{-2} = 100N$$   
> An object with a mass of 10 kilograms and accelerating at 10m/s/s has 100 newtons of force
> 
><h4><u>Acceleration = Force / Mass</u></h4>
>
> $$100N \div 10Kg = 10ms^{-2}$$ <br>
> An object with 100 newtons of force that has a mass of 10 kilograms is accelerating at 10m/s/s
> 
> <h4><u>Mass = Force / Acceleration</u></h4>
> 
> $$100N \div 10ms^{-2} = 10Kg$$ <br>
> An object with 100 newtons of force that is accelerating at 10m/s/s has a mass of 10 kilograms


<b><u>Calculating Displacement</u></b><br>
The formula  for calculating displacement is:<br>

$$Displacement = Velocity \cdot Time$$
<br><br>Where displacement(d) is in metres (m), velocity(v) is in metres per second (m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup>), and time(t) is in seconds (s).

| Name         | Symbol | Unit              | Unit Symbol            |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Displacement | d      | Metres            | m                      |
| Velocity     | v      | Metres per Second | m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup> |
| Time         | t      | Seconds           | s                      |

Like force, you can also calculate velocity and time if you know the distance and the other variable! You can use this Displacement triangle to rearrange the formula:
