# Movement and Forces 


A force is a pull, push, or twist of an object
Unit = Newtons (N)

You can categorize a force in 2 ways:
- Contact force: When the object transmitting the force is in contact with the object receiving the force
- Non-contact force: When the object transmitting the force is not in contact with the object receiving the force

Currently you are experiencing 4 different forces: weight force, support force, push force, and friction. You can pair weight and support together along with push and friction together as they work against each other. Weight force keeps you from floating away while support force keeps you from crumbling into a pancake. Meanwhile push force is what moves you forward while your friction force resists that movement you from moving forward forever.

| Name of Force | Direction of Force | Opposite Force |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Weight        | Down               | Support        |
| Support       | Up                 | Weight         |
| Push          | Forward            | Friction       |
| Friction      | Backward           | Push           |
> [!NOTE] Balanced Weight and Support Forces!
> Since you're not getting crushed by your weight force or floating away from your support force, those forces are currently balanced! Hopefully your weight force doesn't greater than your support force :P

### Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

We use the term balanced and unbalanced to say whether each force and its opposite is equal or not. If a force is balanced that means the forces are equal and therefore you are either stationary or moving at a constant speed relative to the force. Meanwhile if a force is unbalanced then you are accelerating (moving faster and faster). 

![[car_forces_diagram.png]]
> [!NOTE] Arrow Sizes
> Notice how the weight and support arrows are the same size, while the push arrow is larger than the friction arrow? That's because the push force is greater than the friction force!

The weight and support forces are balanced, that means the car isn't floating away or getting crushed which is good. However the push and friction forces are unbalanced. This means the car is accelerating in the direction of the greater force which is the push force.  

To calculate how much push force is exerted on the car, we need to calculate the resultant force. To do so, we use the following equation:<br>

$$Force -OppositeForce=ResultantForce$$

Doing so we can find out there is 2000N of push force being exerted on the car.

## Formulas and Calculation
### Calculating Force

The formula to calculate force is:<br><br>
$$Force = Mass \cdot Acceleration$$
<br><br>Where force (F) is in newtons (N), mass(M) is in kilograms (kg) and Acceleration(A) is in Metres per second per second (m/s/s or ms<sup>-2</sup>) 

| Name         | Symbol | Unit                         | Unit Symbol              |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Force        | f      | Newtons                      | N                        |
| Mass         | m      | Kilograms                    | kg                       |
| Acceleration | a      | Metres per Second per Second | m/s/s or ms<sup>-2</sup> |

>[!NOTE] Weight ≠ Mass
> Weight and mass is different. Weight is a force which is your mass multiplied by gravity. Mass on the other hand is how much the matter you are made up of weighs. To get your Mass from your weight, divide your weight by 10 (or if you want to specific 9.8)
> 
> Weight is also actually measured in newtons, not kilograms :P

You can also calculate mass and acceleration if you know the force and the other variable! You can use this force triangle to rearrange the formula: 

![[force_triangle.jpg]] 


> [!NOTE] Examples
> <h4><u>Force = Mass * Acceleration</u></h4>
> 
> $$10Kg \cdot 10ms^{-2} = 100N$$   
> An object with a mass of 10 kilograms and accelerating at 10m/s/s has 100 newtons of force
> 
><h4><u>Acceleration = Force / Mass</u></h4>
>
> $$100N \div 10Kg = 10ms^{-2}$$ <br>
> An object with 100 newtons of force that has a mass of 10 kilograms is accelerating at 10m/s/s
> 
> <h4><u>Mass = Force / Acceleration</u></h4>
> 
> $$100N \div 10ms^{-2} = 10Kg$$ <br>
> An object with 100 newtons of force that is accelerating at 10m/s/s has a mass of 10 kilograms


### Calculating Displacement

The formula  for calculating displacement is:<br>

$$Displacement = Velocity \cdot Time$$
<br><br>Where displacement(d) is in metres (m), velocity(v) is in metres per second (m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup>), and time(t) is in seconds (s).

| Name         | Symbol | Unit              | Unit Symbol            |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Displacement | d      | Metres            | m                      |
| Velocity     | v      | Metres per Second | m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup> |
| Time         | t      | Seconds           | s                      |

Like force, you can also calculate velocity and time if you know the distance and the other variable! You can use this Displacement triangle to rearrange the formula:

![[velocity_triangle.webp]]

> [!NOTE] Examples
> <h4><u>Displacement = Velocity * Time</u></h4>
> 
> $$10ms^{-1} \cdot 10s = 100m$$   <br>
> An object with an average velocity of 10m/s after 10 seconds would have been displaced 100 metres
> 
><h4><u>Velocity = Displacement / Time</u></h4>
>
> $$100m \div 10s = 10ms^{-1}$$ <br>
> An object that was displaced 100 metres in 10 seconds had an average velocity of 10m/s
> 
> <h4><u>Time = Displacement / Velocity</u></h4>
> 
> $$100m \div 10ms^{-1} = 10s$$ <br>
> An object that was displaced 100 metres with an average velocity of 10m/s travelled for 10s


# Waves and Light Rays

Waves are vibrations that transfer energy as they move. Two common examples of waves are sound and light which both travels as waves. There are two different types of waves: Transverse Waves and Longitudinal Waves

<b><u>Transverse Waves</b></u>

Transverse waves are vibrations that move up and down at a right angle to the direction they’re going. A good example of this is ripples in water. They go up and down while moving outwards!

![[transverse_wave.webp]]

<b><u>Longitudinal Waves</b></u>

Longitudinal waves are a type of wave that moves in the same direction as it vibrates. They work by compressing and then stretching out. So, as the wave travels, the parts of the wave push together and then pull apart! Sound waves are an example of 

![[longitudinal_wave.webp]]

## Measuring Transverse Waves

![[transverse_wave_diagram.webp]]

Transverse Waves are quite simple to measure when giving a visualization of them. Transverse waves have three important measurements: Amplitude, Wavelength, and Frequency. 
- Amplitude is the height of the crest (top) or trough (bottom) of a wave from the resting point
- Wavelength is the distance between two crests or troughs directly next to each other
- Frequency is the number of waves that pass a pint in a second. The unit for frequency is Hertz (Hz)

## Measuring sound

Sound can be described using pitch and loudness. Loudness is how loud something is while Pitch is how high or low the sound sounds. For example bird chirps are typically high pitched while thunder is low pitched. When visualized, sound waves appear to look like a transverse wave. The frequency of the wave correlates with the pitch with a higher frequency meaning a higher pitch. Loudness on the other hand correlates with amplitude of the wave. The greater the amplitude of the wave, the greater the loudness. Using this knowledge we can visualize sounds.

![[sound_wave_pitch_and_loudness.jpg]]

Another way we measure sound is using the Decibel (dB) scale. The Decibel scale measures the loudness and intensity of a sound. Something like breathing that we can barely hear only had a decibel level of around 10dB. Meanwhile something such as thunder has a decibel level of around 120dB.

> [!NOTE] Be Careful!
> Exposure to sounds with high decibel levels for long periods of time can cause temporary or even permanent hearing damage!

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

The electromagnetic spectrum is a range of all the different types of electromagnetic radiation, which are waves of energy. It includes everything from radio waves, which are used for things like FM radio and TV, to gamma rays, which come from radioactive materials. The only difference between them all is how much energy they carry! 

Here are the seven main types of waves in the electromagnetic spectrum:

1. **Radio Waves**: These have the longest wavelength and are used for communication, like in radios and cell phones.
2. **Microwaves**: Slightly shorter than radio waves, microwaves are used for cooking food and in some types of communication.
3. **Infrared**: This type of radiation is felt as heat. Remote controls for TVs use infrared signals.
4. **Visible Light**: This is the part of the spectrum that we can see, and it includes all the colors of the rainbow.
5. **Ultraviolet (UV) Light**: This is shorter than visible light and can cause sunburns. Some animals can see UV light!
6. **X-rays**: These have even shorter wavelengths and are used in medicine to see inside the body.
7. **Gamma Rays**: These have the shortest wavelengths and are very powerful. They come from radioactive materials!

Each type of radiation has different properties and uses, but they all travel at the speed of light.

> [!NOTE] Is all this electromagnetic radiation bad for us?
> Although some electromagnetic waves can be harmful for us and our health, it is important to understand that the electromagnetic we use on a daily basis do not harm us in anyway. This is because they don't have enough energy.

## Light Rays and Shadows

Light is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see! Light is a Transverse Wave which means it travels in a straight line. If there is something opaque (not see through) between you and the light ray, it will create a shadow! Shadows are created when there is less light in an area due to light rays being blocked. 

![[light_ray_and_shadow.webp]]

There are three types of objects that allow varying levels of light through them:

| Word            | Definition                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Opaque      | Opaque objects are objects that do not let any light through       |
| Translucent | Translucent objects are objects that only allow some light through |
| Transparent | Transparent objects are objects that allow all light through       |

## How Light Works

Light comes in seven different colours with three primary colours of light. 
The seven different colours: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet are the colour of the rainbow and can remembered with the acronym ROY G BIV. Each colour has its own wavelength with red being the longest and it decreases in order until reaching violet which has the shortest wave length! 

There are also three primary colours of light are Red, Green, and Blue which can be abbreviated as RGB. Primary colours are colours of light that can be used to make every other colour in the colour spectrum! 

![[colours_of_light.jpg]]

## Seeing the world!

You may be wondering, how are things all a certain colour? Well its simple, I just never got a chance to explain it yet. The sun emits white light rays which are made up of every colour of the rainbow. When these light rays hit an object, the object will reflect the light it is, while absorbing the rest of the light. 
For example, if white light hits a red hat, the red hat will only reflect red light because it absorbs the other colours of light. This also means that blue light will make the red hat appear black, as there is no light to reflect! 

If you want to understand how the eye works, it is explained more in [[Biology#Eyes |Biology]]!

![[red_light_reflecting_off_red_apple.webp]]
## Refraction

Have you ever noticed how a straw looks like it splits in two when its viewed in a glass filled with water? This is due to refraction. Refraction occurs when light changes speed and direction when it moves from one medium into another. The straw appears bent because light travels faster in air than through the liquid. Since it slows down when it enter the liquid, the light bends towards the normal. 

Here is another example of refraction:
![[refraction_example.png]]

As the Incidence Ray enters the glass rectangle, the refracted ray bends towards the normal. This gives the Incidence Ray a greater angle than the refracted ray and therefore the Angle of incidence is greater than the Angle of Refraction.

> [!NOTE] What does medium mean?
> The word medium refers to a substance that light will travel through. A medium can be a solid, liquid, or gas! 

Refraction is also the reason why light splits when it hits a prism! Different colors of light, such as red, orange, and blue, travel at slightly different speeds in glass, so they bend by different amounts. As the light enters and exits the prism, this bending causes the colors to spread out and form a spectrum of colours.

![[light_prism.png]]
# Mirrors and Lens

When a ray of light bounces of a surface, this is called reflection. Reflection is best seen in mirrors as they have a smooth and shiny surface. There are three different types of mirrors and two different types of lens. They are the Plane mirror, Concave Mirror, Convex Mirror, Concave Lens, and Convex Lens. Each of which are extremely important in this world!

All mirrors follow the law of reflection. This makes reflection on mirrors extremely predictable. The law of reflection states:

> [!NOTE] *The angle of incidence of a light ray is equal to the angle of reflection when that ray hits a surface*

To put it simply, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 
## Plane Mirror

The simplest mirror is the Plane Mirror. The plane mirror is a flat mirror that reflects light. Since it is a flat mirror, it is by far the easiest to calculate and visualize the angle of reflection. Here is a diagram of a plane mirror:

![[plane_mirror_example.png]]

As you can see, the angle of incidence and angle of reflection is equal. This means it is following the law of reflection!

Another diagram used to represent plane mirrors is this one:

![[virtual_image_in_plane_mirror.jpg]]

This is a diagram showing a virtual image. A virtual image is an image that appears to be behind a mirror but is not. This virtual image tends to appear the same distance away as the real object is to the mirror. 

Using this information, we can explain how a periscope works! 

![[periscope.webp]]

Light enters the end of the periscope where it hits a mirror at a 45 degree angle. Since the angle of incidence is at 45 degrees, so will the angle of reflection. This means the light ray will travel at a 90 degree downwards! The light ray then travels into another plane mirror at a 45 degree angle which, again, will travel 90 degrees for the same reason. This light ray will then reach the eye of the user of the periscope where they will be able to see through the periscope.

## Concave Mirrors and Convex Mirrors

Concave mirrors are mirrors that bend inwards. Concave mirrors have a focal point, labelled F in the diagram below where all the light is focused. This basically means its the point where all the reflected light meet. An example of concave mirrors are headlights which are used to create a beam of light that can travel a long distance.

![[concave_mirror_diagram.jpg]]

<br>
Convex mirrors are mirrors that bend outwards. Convex mirrors also have a focal point, however this is the point where the image appears to have originated from after reflecting off the mirror. An example of convex mirrors are security mirrors which allow people to see around corners easily.

![[convex_mirror_diagram.jpg]]


> [!NOTE] Is it a Concave or Convex?
> An easy way to remember the difference between a Concave and Convex is by looking at the suffix of the name. Caves go into the earth and Concave mirrors go inwards. I use this knowledge when I am wondering if its Concave or Convex that goes inwards

## Concave Lens and Convex Lens

Concave lens are lens that curve inwards on both sides, causing the light rays to refract outwards and diverge. There is also a focal point in the Concave lens which is the point where the refracted light rays appear to come from. An example of a concave lens are glasses made to correct near-sightedness. This is because concave lens spreads light out and makes things appear smaller and further away. 

![[concave_lens_diagram.png]]

<br>
Convex lens are lens that curve outwards on both sides, causing the light rays to refract inwards and converge. There is also a focal point in the Convex lens which is the point where the refracted light is all focused. This basically means its the point where all the refracted light meet.  An example of a Convex lens is a magnifying glass. This is because Convex Lens magnify objects by focusing light rays into the focal point. 

![[convex_lens_diagram.png]]
# Electricity and Magnetism *WIP*

As we know, everything is made out of atoms. Atoms are made up of  electrons, protons and neutrons. So, why is this important? Neutrons aren't that important in this situation however since we're all made up of electrons and protons that means everything has a charge. 

Most objects are not electrically charged, this is because they have the same amount of electrons, which have a negative charge, and protons, which have a positive charge. This makes them, as stated earlier, not electrically charged and as such electrically neutral. For example this ball would be electrically neutral as they have the same amount of electrons and protons.

![[neutrally_charged_object.png]] 


The thing about charges is that they can repel and attract. This is because they want to be electrically neutral. As such if they are positively or negatively charged, they will repel things with the same charge as them. However if something had a different charge to them, then they would attract the object. This table below is an easy way to remember it:

| Charges | +       | -       |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| +       | Repel   | Attract |
| -       | Attract | Repel   |

> [!NOTE] As the saying goes, Opposites attract!
<br>



### Conductors and Insulators

One final thing we need to learn about are conductors and insulators! 
<br>
<b><u>Conductors</u></b> <br>

Conductors are simply substances that allow electrons (charge) to flow through easily! You can think of conductors as basically a greenlight, allowing all the electrons to go through.

Common examples of conductors are:
- Metals (Such as copper, gold, and brass)
- Non-distilled Water (Normal drinking water)
<br>
<br>

<b><u>Insulators</u></b> <br>

Insulators are, as the name suggests, substances that don't allow electrons (charge) to flow through easily. You can think of electricity as heat. Insulators, like in houses, trap the heat and make it hard for it to escape through the insulation. Insulators do the same thing with electricity. Although they have the same name, the insulators in houses and in electricity are not the same!

Common examples of insulators are:
- Plastics
- Glass
- Wool
- Distilled Water (Pure water)

## Electricity

### Static Electricity

Now that we've learnt about charges, we can understand what Electricity is and how Electricity works. There are two types of Electricity: Static and Current/Live. Static Electricity occurs naturally and you've probably experienced it yourself. Have you ever been jumping on a trampoline and when you went to get off, been zapped by the metal framing of the trampoline? That was static electricity! 

Static electricity is when the amount of positive and negative charges on the surface of a material or between materials are different. So how does this occur? We can make static electricity occur by rubbing two materials against each other. This works best with insulators rather than conductors since electrons can't move well in insulators! 

So why does rubbing two materials against each other create static electricity? When the two objects rub against each other, this allows electrons to be transferred from one object to the other, giving said object more electrons than protons and therefore a negative charge. 

Certain conditions allow for static electricity to work best, it is important to understand why!

| Condition                                | Why?                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The materials should be insulators       | The materials must be insulators so the charge cannot disperse              |
| The materials must be rubbed together    | Friction is required to move charges from one material to the other         |
| The materials and atmosphere must be dry | Dry conditions ensure that the charge is not conducted away in the moisture |


![[balloon.png]] <br>
![[balloon2.png]]

> [!NOTE] An example of static electricity 
> An example of static electricity is when you rub a balloon on your hair. The friction caused by rubbing the balloon on your head transfers electrons from your hair to the balloon. This leaves your hair positively charged and the balloon negatively charged. As we know, objects with the same charge repel each other, so our individual hairs repel each other which causes them to separate and stand on end. <br><br> ![[cat_static.jpg]]


### Current Electricity 
<br>
Current/Live electricity is the electricity that comes out of the outlets in your walls. This can be used to power electrical components and is used to power everything from lights and fans to fridges, washing machine, and computers! From now on I will refer to current electricity as simply electricity. 

Electricity flows through circuits. Circuits are a path which electrons flow through and are composed of electronic components and an energy source which is connected by wires. 

## Circuits
<br>
Before you can begin drawing circuits, there are a few things you need to know before hand. The first are circuit symbols and their functions:

<b><u>Wire</u></b> 
Wires are what directs the flow of the electrons and connects the electrical components to the energy source of the circuit.  

<b><u>Cell</u></b> 
Cells are an energy source that powers a circuit. Electrons flow through the smaller side of the cell (The negative side) through the circuit and back to the bigger side of the cell (The positive side). This happens because electrons are negatively charged and are therefore repelled from the negative side of the cell. Their attraction to positive particles helps them flow through the circuit where they then travel back to the cell. 

<b><u>Battery</u></b> 
Batteries are a multi-cell energy source that powers a circuit. Electrons flow through the side of the battery that ends with a small line (The negative side) through the circuit and back to the side of the battery that ends with a bigger line (The positive side). This happens because electrons are negatively charged and are therefore repelled from the negative side of the battery. Their attraction to positive particles helps them flow through the circuit where they then travel back to the battery. 

<b><u>Switch</u></b> 
Switches are 

<b><u>Bulb</u></b> 
Bulbs are light bulbs. They turn electrical energy into light energy...

<b><u>Voltmeter</u></b> 


<b><u>Ammeter</u></b> 
<b><u>Resistor</u></b>
<b><u>Fuse</u></b>
