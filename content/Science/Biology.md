# Plants 
## Seed
![[seed_diagram.png]]
In a seed there are five major parts of a seed: the Plumule, the Radicle, the Micropyle, the Testa, and the Cotyledon. Each serve an important role in the growth of a seed into a seedling:
- The Plumule is the part of the plant embryo that grows into the stem and first leaves of the plant. 
- The Radicle is the part of the plant embryo that grows into the primary root. The emergence of the Radicle is the first sign of germination!
- The Micropyle is a small opening in the Testa of a seed which allows water and oxygen to enter during germination. 
- The Testa is the hard outer layer of the seed that protects the embryo and helps control germination, protecting the plant embryo from environmental conditions. 
- The Cotyledon helps supply nutrition to the plant embryo needed for germination until the seedling can begin photosynthesis.

## Germination
Germination is the process where a seed turns into a seedling. To germinate, a seed requires three things: water, soil, and oxygen.

| In the first stage, the Radicle emerges from the seed as it breaks through the Testa, growing downwards further into the soil. | Following the emergence of the Radicle, the primary root continues to grow downwards as root hairs sprout off the radicle. Meanwhile the Plumule lifts the cotyledon out of the soil with the plumule | Finally, the cotyledon falls off as the leaves of the seedling are formed. These leaves begin photosynthesis, enabling the plant to make its own food. The roots are also further developed as they spread throughout the soil. |

### Photosynthesis and Respiration

Photosynthesis Word Equation:

$Carbon \space Dioxide + Water\xrightarrow[\text{Chlorophyll}]{\text{Light Energy}} Glucose + Oxygen$

Respiration Word Equation:

$$Glucose+Oxygen \rightarrow Carbon \space Dioxide + Water + Energy$$

## Blood and Blood Vessels

Blood is made up of four different components, each with their own functions. The table below with describe the function of each of the different components:

| Component         | Function                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Red Blood Cells   | Transports oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body            |
| White Blood Cells | Fights invaders such as bacteria and viruses by creating antibodies |
| Platelets         | Helps prevent and stops bleeding by forming clots                   |
| Plasma            | Transports nutrients, proteins, and hormones throughout the body    |

<h3><u>Blood Vessels</u></h3> 
There are three different types of blood vessels: Arteries, Veins, and Capillaries, each with their own definition and characteristics. Arteries and Veins are the major blood vessels!
