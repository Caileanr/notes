# Plants 
## Inside a seed
![[seed_diagram.png]]
In a seed there are five major parts of a seed: the Plumule, the Radicle, the Micropyle, the Testa, and the Cotyledon. Each serve an important role in the growth of a seed into a seedling:
- The Plumule is the part of the plant embryo that grows into the stem and first leaves of the plant. 
- The Radicle is the part of the plant embryo that grows into the primary root. The emergence of the Radicle is the first sign of germination!
- The Micropyle is a small opening in the Testa of a seed which allows water and oxygen to enter during germination. 
- The Testa is the hard outer layer of the seed that protects the embryo and helps control germination, protecting the plant embryo from environmental conditions. 
- The Cotyledon helps supply nutrition to the plant embryo needed for germination until the seedling can begin photosynthesis.

## Germination
Germination is the process where a seed turns into a seedling. To germinate, a seed requires three things: water, soil, and oxygen.

| Stage 1                                                                                                                        | Stage 2                                                                                                                                                                                               | Stage 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| In the first stage, the Radicle emerges from the seed as it breaks through the Testa, growing downwards further into the soil. | Following the emergence of the Radicle, the primary root continues to grow downwards as root hairs sprout off the radicle. Meanwhile the Plumule lifts the cotyledon out of the soil with the plumule | Finally, the cotyledon falls off as the leaves of the seedling are formed. These leaves begin photosynthesis, enabling the plant to make its own food. The roots are also further developed as they spread throughout the soil. |

## Roots
Roots have a couple functions for the plant.  The first and most well known is that roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil, this vital role allows for photosynthesis and the growth of the plant. The second role of the roots is to anchor the plant, preventing the plant from being washed away by some water or blown away by some wind. Finally, roots also store food such as starches, nutrients, and sugars for later use!

> [!NOTE] Root Vegetables
> Root vegetables, such as Potatoes, are enlarged roots which are used to store large quantities of starch and nutrients. This is what makes potatoes and other root vegetables so nutritious!

## Stem
In the stem there are are tubes inside the stem that allows for the transportation of water and food throughout the plant, these tubes are called the Xylem and Phloem. 

The Xylem is responsible for carrying water and minerals from the roots up into the leaves. Using a process called cohesion where water molecules are attracted to each other, water moves up the Xylem into the leaves.

The Phloem is responsible for transporting the plant's food throughout the plant. The Phloem can transport nutrients and glucose both up and down the plant!

## Leaves
![[inside_leaf.png]]

There are many things inside of a leaf, however the main two parts you need to worry about are the Chloroplasts and the Stomata. 

The Stomata are small openings on the bottom of a leaf that allow for Carbon Dioxide to enter the leaf for Photosynthesis and the release of Oxygen after Photosynthesis.

The Chloroplast is a part of the leaf that creates and contains Chlorophyll which traps sunlight energy. It is also where the photosynthesis reaction occurs!

> [!NOTE] Why are plants green?
> Have you ever wondered why plants are green? Well this is because of a green pigment responsible for Photosynthesis called Chlorophyll! Basically Chlorophyll just makes the leaves of a plant green.

### Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transforms light energy into chemical energy. This is done by converting Carbon Dioxide and Water into Glucose (Sugar/Food) and Oxygen. 

$Carbon \space Dioxide + Water\xrightarrow[\text{Chlorophyll}]{\text{Light Energy}} Glucose + Oxygen$

### Respiration

Respiration is the biochemical process that converts Glucose and Oxygen into Energy, Water, and Carbon Dioxide which allows the cells in plants to perform essential functions. Basically, the plant breaks down food it produces, creating energy along with other by products.

$$Glucose+Oxygen \rightarrow Carbon \space Dioxide + Water + Energy$$

### Testing for Starch

A major product created in photosynthesis is a type of sugar called glucose. Since plants can't store glucose, they turn it into starch which is basically long chains of glucose. As proving something happens is an important thing in Science, we can test that starch is getting produced in a leaf, and see if a plant actually requires sunlight to produce starch, by using an iodine solution. Iodine is normally a brown colour, however it turns bluey-black in the presence of starch! 
## Flowers

![[flower_diagram.png]]

There are multiple parts of the flower, each with its own function:

| Part       | Function                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stamen     | The male part of the flower which includes the Anther and Filament                        |
| Anther     | Produces and stores pollen                                                                |
| Filament   | Supports the Anther                                                                       |
| Pistil     | The female part of the flower which includes the Stigma, Style, and Ovary                 |
| Stigma     | The female part of the flower where pollen is needed to land to germinate the flower      |
| Style      | Supports the stigma and connects it to the ovary                                          |
| Ovary      | The female reproductive organ of a flower where fertilization and seed development occurs |
| Pedal      | Brightly coloured to attract animals                                                      |
| Sepal      | The outer parts of the flower that encloses a developing bud                              |
| Receptacle | The part of a stalk where the flower is attached                                          |
| Pollen     | The male gamete of the flower                                                             |
| Ovules     | The female gamete of the flower                                                           |
| Bud        | Protects the developing flower before it opens                                            |
## Pollination

Pollination is the process where pollen from the male reproductive part of the flower (the anther) is transferred to the female reproductive part (the stigma). There are two different types of pollination: Self Pollination and Cross Pollination. Self pollination occurs when pollen from the anther of a flower fertilizes its own stigma. Cross pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of a different flower. 

<b><u>How does pollen get spread?</b></u>

Pollination occurs when pollen from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma of a flower. This can happen in three different ways: Wind pollination, Insect pollination, and animal pollination. Wind pollination is when pollen is carried and spread by the wind. Meanwhile insect pollination is when an insect transfers pollen from one flower to another, animal pollination is similar where animals other than insects such as birds or bats transfer pollen. 


> [!NOTE] Pollinators!
> Insects and animals that transfer pollen from the anther of a flower to the stigma of a flower are called pollinators. These include bees, butterflies, birds, bats, and other insects and animals.


# Human Body

## Blood and Blood Vessels

Blood is made up of four different components, each with their own functions. The table below with describe the function of each of the different components:

| Component         | Function                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Red Blood Cells   | Transports oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body            |
| White Blood Cells | Fights invaders such as bacteria and viruses by creating antibodies |
| Platelets         | Helps prevent and stops bleeding by forming clots                   |
| Plasma            | Transports nutrients, proteins, and hormones throughout the body    |
